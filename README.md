# Email Analyzer Backend

## Overview
The **Email Analyzer Backend** is a Node.js/Express.js application that connects to a Gmail account via IMAP, retrieves emails with subjects starting with `Test-`, parses their headers to identify the Email Service Provider (ESP) and receiving chain, and stores results in MongoDB.  
It exposes API endpoints for the frontend to generate subjects and process emails.

## Features
